Q: Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a0到a7；a2

Q: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: f和g函数都没有直接被main调用，因为f和g形式都比较简单，都被内联到了main中，应该属于某种优化

Q: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x628

Q: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x38，即jalr下一条指令的地址

Q: Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
    What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
    The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: 输出是HE110 World。如果变成大端法，i就需要变成0x726c6400，但57616不需要设置为其他值，因为是直接输出57616的16进制，和大端/小端机器无关。

Q: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A: 会打印出a2寄存器的值，具体是多少取决于之前的代码。
